			<h2 class="white-color">Mrs. Simpson, Head of Computer Science, Saint Cecilia's Church of England School (July 2021)</h2>	
			<p>"Although I have only known Tom since I arrived at Saint Cecilia’s this year, his reputation for being a thoughtful and conscientious student was relayed to me from his past tutors. Tom has a caring and sensitive nature that initially comes across as shy and quiet but hides his patient and tolerant nature.  He has impressed me with his thirst for knowledge and understanding of coding in particular, having clearly taught himself a range of coding skills that demonstrated his prior Python knowledge. He has a good memory for factual information so is easily able to learn supporting facts and theory behind applications.  If I have to find a small fault with Tom it was his struggle with the demands of remote learning and homework submission during lock down at the start of this year, where his grades dropped to a level C (level 4).  However, he has worked hard and has enjoyed his coding unit this term, restoring his grade to a B (level 7) predicted GCSE Computer Science End of Year 11 Grade.  I confidently commend him as a young man of considerable potential that will do well from the work experience scheme you are offering him."</p>

			<h2 class="white-color">Miss Brunt, Year 6, Wimbledon Park Primary School (July 2018)</h2>
			<p>“Tom is a quiet, sensitive and friendly boy. He is aware of those around him and is always prepared to encourage and support anybody
			in whatever they do. Tom has built a reputation for being a ‘good guy’ due to his positive, generous and laid-back nature. Academically,
			Tom has proven this year to be determined, focused and able. When working both in class and in smaller groups, Tom’s contribution is
			always valuable. Continuing into Secondary school with this outstanding attitude towards his peers and his learning will only lead to great
			success”.</p>
			<br/>
			<h2 class="white-color">Miss Davis, Director, Free Spirited (December 2017)</h2>
			<p>“Free Spirited provides yoga to children in schools. At the end of term, I always like to present the children with a little gift, to thank
			them for their participation. With nearly 30 children in a class, it is quite a task for me to get these, but with Tom’s unique service it was
			a breeze for me this term. He came up with some great suggestions for gifts and delivered them on time and at a very reasonable price.
			The children were very happy! An amazing service from someone so young”.</p>
