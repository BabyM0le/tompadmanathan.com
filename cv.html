                                   <h6>August 2022</h6>
                                   <p>I was excited to be invited to the Mini Taster Day at Hutch Games. I'm interested in gaming as I've always thought that it is at the cutting edge of software development. I now understand why! I wanted to create a game ahead of this event so I could appreciate the environments their Development team works in. I have realised that to properly learn Unity and the technology surrounding it I needed more time. I hope to complete my first game in Unity in two weeks. I ended up spending 4 hours on site I met professionals from Human Resources, Development, Producing, and Community Management. I was particularly interested in their software development process and why Unity was chosen as the engine of choice. I would like to thank the Hutch team for this opportunity.</p>

                                   <p>After completing my first year at GCSE level and in advance of starting my internship, I was keen to build my first software modules. The goal was to self-learn JavaScript, C#  and Unity to create some extremely basic offerings in the first week in August. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BabyM0le?tab=repositories" class="hyperlink">Here</a> to view "Password generator" and "Sentence Case". All feedback welcome. My first basic game will appear here next week.</p>

                                   <h6>May 2022</h6>
                                   <p>At the start of 2020, I began playing a video game called CS:GO. I noticed that a lot of people had expensive skins and I realised I could capitalise on this so that is exactly what I did. In the beginning, I deposited £20 into my steam wallet and traded it up to £35. This made me see the potential of the CS:GO skin market. I kept on depositing, buying, selling, and trading for profit. I ended up making more than £2,000 and still counting my current inventory value is £1,700. I've enjoyed the process and met a lot of good friends whilst doing this.
