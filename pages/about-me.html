                                        <div class="title-bar"></div>
                                        <p>My name is Tom and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer. I am almost one year into volunteering for WiSH as their Full Stack Developer. This role involved setting up their IT Department, managing and creating their website, cloud-based document repository, email management, and an IT help desk, and managing all media at numerous WiSH events. </p>
                                        <p>The three words I would use to describe myself are: creative, motivated, and funny. Some of my achievements include building a new profitable business and helping the launch of a new £32 million football stadium by configuring new point of sale machines for up to 9,000 fans. </p>
                                        <p>Besides building the technology capability for a new registered museum/charity in London, I have built both client and server infrastructure and provided IT support for office staff. I achieved this by self-learning hardware and software technologies (i.e. operating Linux processes, computer building/modding, networking, cryptocurrency, WordPress soldering, HTML, CSS, javascript).</p>

                                        <p>During my time at WiSH, I realised how little I know about the industry I am trying to enter. Right now “I don't know what I don’t know” but what I do have is time. Time is one of the few things I have above the experts in the field and I plan to use it as effectively as I can. At the time of writing, I'm trying to learn the basics of different technologies, I have already completed: HTML, CSS, WordPress, Linux, computer hardware, networking, and cryptocurrency. I'm in the process of JavaScript and Electronics. My next venture might be C# in Unity. Researching my possible career options online many people advise against this method and suggest picking something and sticking with it however in my case I disagree. Due to my young age, I have decided to lean away from picking a specificity and become more of a generalist because who knows what I will want to do in 3 years when I finish my education? For as long as I can remember I have always been interested in how things work (not just in computers) and now I feel like technology is providing me a way to use this passion in my daily life and hopefully in the future as my full-time occupation.</p>

                                        <p>As mentioned previously when I look at taking on a new project, I think of 2 things. Is this something I am interested in? Or is this something I can benefit from? For example, making this website: This website gave me a brilliant excuse to put into practice my HTML and CSS skills that I have been sharpening for the last year working on different projects and allowed me to showcase my CV and my career in a creative manner. As a bonus I also enjoyed working on this website, learning new techniques, and finding creative ways to tackle a problem. I am keen to build a long-term career with a company in software development and to prove my dedication, I will not require a wage in 2022. My goal is to work full-time each summer and part-time during the year. The goal is to continue to self-learn and most importantly make the placement work by providing tangible outputs which adds value to the business. This is the winning formula I adopted at WiSH.</p>

                                        <p>People often ask me what my hobbies are and my response is always technology. What else do I enjoy? In my free time, I also enjoy cooking. Ever since I can remember I've been helping my mother in the kitchen making a roast dinner or an apple crumble, however, in the last 5 years I've been stepping up my game learning in a professional kitchen how to cook authentic Italian food and self-learning other cuisines such as Thai, South Indian, and Lebanese. I also enjoy carpentary. I have enjoyed fitness as the main part of my life (Winning the LEGIT cycling competition with over 600 participants. Completing a David Lloyd swimming challenge in 2010 where I swam 52 lengths. I completed a running challenge and ran a mile a day for 6 months. I completed the London to Brighton bike ride when I was 10 and again at 11 (this time I rode the Ditching Beacon without stopping). In 2019, I cycled through Switzerland, Germany, and Austria with a backpack (200miles in 5 days).</p>
