At the end of term, I always like to present the children with a little gift, to thank them for their participation. With nearly 30 children in a class, it is quite a task for me to get these, but with Tom's unique service it was a breeze for me this term. He came up with some great suggestions for gifts and delivered them on time and at a very reasonable price. The children were very happy! An amazing service from someone so young”</p>

                                        <p>“Tom Padmanathan has been working since July 2021 as a volunteer at Wimbledon in Sporting History (WiSH) - principally looking after its IT services - and is a trusted, valued and highly competent member of the WiSH team.
                                             In the summer of 2021 Tom concentrated on designing and installing a new website for WiSH, which ensured the charity had a properly functioning and impressive portal to the outside world. Tom has set up WiSH email accounts for WiSH volunteers with an IT support desk to troubleshoot any IT issues.
                                             Tom also helps out on the communications side of the charity, taking photographs and recording video at major launch events which are an integral part of the WiSH comms team's publicity work. He combines this with updating the website with news features that are provided but which he ensures look professional on delivery to the website.
                                             Tom gets on with tasks assigned to him diligently, methodically and always to a very good standard. He is quiet but committed and always happy to ask for advice or help when needed. Tom has been and is a real asset to Wimbledon in Sporting History, and I have no hesitation in recommending him as a reliable, honest and hardworking young man”.</p>

                                             <p>“Tom is a quiet, sensitive and friendly boy. He is aware of those around him and is always prepared to encourage and support anybody in whatever they do. Tom has built a reputation s for being a ‘good guy’ due to his positive, generous and laid-back nature. Academically, Tom has proven this year to be determined, focused and able. When working both in class and in smaller groups, Tom’s contribution is always valuable. Continuing into Secondary school with this outstanding attitude towards his peers and his learning will only lead to great success”</p>

                                             <p>“Although I have only known Tom since I arrived at Saint Cecilia's this year, his reputation for being a thoughtful and conscientious student was relayed to me from his past tutors.  Tom has a caring and sensitive nature that initially comes across as shy and quiet but hides his patient and tolerant nature.  He has impressed me with his thirst for knowledge and understanding of coding in particular, having clearly taught himself a range of coding skills that demonstrated his prior Python knowledge.  He has a good memory for factual information so is easily able to learn supporting facts and theory behind applications.  If I have to find a small fault with Tom it was his struggle with the demands of remote learning and homework submission during lockdown at the start of this year, where his grades dropped to a level C (level 4).  However, he has worked hard and has enjoyed his coding unit this term, restoring his grade to a B (level 7) predicted GCSE Computer Science End of Year 11 Grade.  I confidently commend him as a young man of considerable potential that will do well from the work experience scheme you are offering him.”</p>
