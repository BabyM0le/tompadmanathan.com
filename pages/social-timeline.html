                                   <p>As my interview at WiSH was fast approaching, I decided to make a CV website to test my skills and demonstrate my creativity. This was a challenging task as I had never done anything similar to this before, so I was just learning as I went along. After about a week of development, I finally launched it on a free subdomain on my personal computer.

                                   <p>After my first year at Saint Cecilias (Year 7), I received an award for the highest score in Mathematics in my year (150 students). Only a few years prior, I needed extra tuition in this subject. It was great relief to see my hard work paying off and what I can achieve if I put my mind to a task. Two and a half years later I received a best improvement in the year in Science.</p>

                                   <p>I have always been fascinated by different exotic animals and in 2019 my dream of owning one became true. For my birthday, my Dad said I could finally get some pet turtles, after a two-hour drive we collected them, the tank, and the fish and brought them home. I named them: Kiki and Zen. They will live until i'm 56 years old!</p>

                                   <p>In 2019, I set off on a 5 day cycling challenge to Lake Constance. We cycled 200 miles in five days across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This was my 'Comming of Age' trip for my thirteenth birthday.</p>

                                   <p>All my friends at school had a gaming machine whether it be a: console, laptop, or PC. I thought I was missing out, so I did some research into it and decided to build my very first computer. After ordering the parts from Amazon, my friend Ben and I spent a few hours assembling it and setting it up and it worked! This kickstarted my career and hobbies in technology.</p>

                                   <p>Similar to other things, music is something I was never naturally talented in and had to learn through hard work and patience. After a short period of learning the guitar, I wrote and performed 'My Music' at Saint Cecilias music scholarship program. I was sad to hear I was 2 points away from a music scholarship offer, however, it was still an amazing experience and I hope to improve my guitar in the future.</p>

                                   <p>After two years of preparation, it was time to sit for my SATS. This was my first major examination and I was nervous. I was happy to find out my results: 91% English Reading, 92% SPAG, and 94% in Mathematics. It would be an understatement to say I was relieved.</p>

After 8 hours, 56miles, and a lot of superfoods we finally made it and I enjoyed it. I completed the challenge an aditional three times.</p>

                                   <p>In 2018 the entire Wimbledon Park Primary School (600 students) competed in a cycling race around Richmond Park (7.5miles). Once we set off I was in the lead, I kept my position for most of the race until I broke suddenly and my chain came off my bike. I quickly stopped to put it back on but I had already lost my lead, with only one mile to go I pulled into the lead and won the event. It was a very fun event and I ended up going around 2 more times. This lit up my love for cycling even more.</p>

                                   <p>I was delighted to hear that an Italian Restaurant was allowing me to learn to cook professionally. Once I got there I first learned all the techniques and ways to make arrabbiata, then later moved on to make pizza in an authentic wood-fired pizza oven. I still used the recipe they taught me and am forever grateful to the family-run restaurant for giving me this experience.</p>
