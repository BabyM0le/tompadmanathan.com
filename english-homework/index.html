            <p>Samuel Johnson, an eighteenth-century English writer, once said, 'When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life'. There's something for everyone in London. It's an exciting metropolis, teeming with entertainment, full of history and offering many sightseeing opportunities. Lost and confused, some visitors are so overwhelmed that they don't know where to begin. Here is some useful advice for a hassle-free holiday.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Getting Around<p></p>
            <p>Tired, weary and footsore, some tourists underestimate the size of the 25th largest city in the world. Why not make things easy for yourself with a hop-on, hop-off bus tour? This is the most economical way to learn about London, and it's a great way to gain your bearings and to sight-see at the same time! If you stop at St. Paul's Cathedral and you fancy going inside, for example, simply hop off, visit the cathedral and then hop on the next bus!</p>
